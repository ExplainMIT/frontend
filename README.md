# ExplainMIT
Our goal is to create a student-driven explanation platform for MIT, so that no one has to stay up late and study alone.

## Technology
Explanation videos are 10-50x lighter because we represent them with sparse blackboard strokes rather than exhaustive pixel colors. 
Here are some consequences: 
- Upload time is 10x faster 
- Sliding to any part of a video requires no buffering
- Visual explanations are not separate entities (e.g. displayed one at a time on Youtube), but instead fully-integrated utilized among text and images

## Philosophy 
Despite the rise of digital learning, academic material is still mostly text-based. Feynman brings vivid explanations to every subject by making the content creation process 10x faster.

Feynman's goal is to minimize the cost of creating elegant explanations.

Everything starts with a question. "What is the intuition behind P = NP?". A classmate responds, and invites you to a classroom. He draws on the whiteboard, and soon the doodles come to life.

He focuses on the thought process: "Notice that the complexity class of the oracle machine is ... that's exactly the same as ..." "Why do the sets intersect there?" "Ah, I'm glad that you asked that, it's because..." ... ... ... "There's a quote that beautifully encapsulates the concept:

If P = NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place...There would be no special value in "creative leaps,"...Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss..."

"I like that." ... ... ... "Ohhhh, everything makes sense now!"

That magical Eureka moment, the inexplicable journey from chaos to clarity that you just undertook - how wonderful.

"Thank you for that - my friends and I really struggled with the last few lectures..." "Happy to help. If your friends still have problems with this, just try explaining to them the same thing. Remember what Richard Feynman said - if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it." "Yes." "And, one more thing, in case you forget what I said..."

He presses a button, and right before your eyes, the messy scribbles on the whiteboard clear up. Then strokes start reappearing and rearranging themselves. Venn diagrams, Directed Acylic Graphs and equations, everything that he talked about and scribbled came back to life - like a vivid dance of words and numbers, moving in harmony to convey meaning in the most elegant of ways. It was as if you relived the journey once more.

"Good luck for your midterm. Remember, always spread the joy of learning to the people around you!"

And just like that, he disappears. You remain, smiling, pondering about what had just happened.

## Team
Our goal is to make learning fun and efficient for students. Everything else is secondary. We aim to achieve MIT-wide adoption of explain.mit.edu, and when that becomes reality, we will create a startup based on this proof-of-concept.

# ExplainMIT
Our goal is to create a student-driven explanation platform for MIT, so that no one has to stay up late and study alone.

## Technology
Explanation videos are 10-50x lighter because we represent them with sparse blackboard strokes rather than exhaustive pixel colors. 
Here are some consequences: 
- Upload time is 10x faster 
- Sliding to any part of a video requires no buffering
- Visual explanations are not separate entities (e.g. displayed one at a time on Youtube), but instead fully-integrated utilized among text and images

## Team
Our goal is to make learning fun and efficient for students. Everything else is secondary. We aim to achieve MIT-wide adoption of explain.mit.edu, and when that becomes reality, we will create a startup based on this proof-of-concept. 

Current members: 
- Prabhakar Kafle
- Winston Fee
- Elton Lin

We are recruiting (email eltonlin@mit.edu)!

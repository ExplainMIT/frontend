# Explain
Explain is a conspiracy to eradicate the disease of hearts of people. 

Part I: Create a vibrant, electrifying community at MIT where everybody helps each other
This will involve an experimental prototype that drastically increases learning efficiency. It will also involve creating a system where, no matter how behind anyone feels, they'd know that there is an army of classmates and TAs who would jump at the opportunity to help out. 

Part II: Build a grand explanation platform for the world
This will involve democratizing education so everyone regardless of their circumstances can access the best resources for free, therefore increasing their potential to change the world. 

Part III: End poverty and pollution by 2035
Education is ultimately a "sword" that needs to be directed at our most urgent problems.

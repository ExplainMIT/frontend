# ExplainMIT
The Explain Project will create the most efficient explanation platform for MIT, so that no one has to stay up late and study alone.

## Technology
We achieved a 10x reduction in video compression by representing videos with sparse blackboard strokes rather than exhaustive pixel colors. Here are some consequences: 
- Upload time is 10x faster 
- Sliding to any part of a video requires no buffering
- Visual explanations is a first-class citizen of the website's structure, and is just as easy to create and share as text

## Team
ExplainMIT is a school project with the goal to make every class at MIT more fun and efficient. The day that becomes reality, we will consider transitioning into a startup. 

Current members:

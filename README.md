# ExplainMIT [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/LingDingDong/feynman-mvp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/LingDingDong/feynman-mvp)

The ExplainMIT project is a website built by MIT students in order to make learning more efficient and collaborative. 

## Problem
Help is a scarce resource because the time of professors, TAs and students are limited.

## Solution
Our website lets people share knowledge efficiently. To explain concepts to someone, you can both visit the website, then proceed to talk and draw on a real-time blackboard. If both of you can't be on at the same time, you can record and share lightweight pseudo-videos, built to use 100x less memory.

After each session, you can click "SAVE" to archive the blackboard's entire progression as a silent animation, add some title and description, and save that as an explanation on the platform. For one-sided teaching interactions, you can simply record the entire explanation and save it as a video explanation. In other words, by frequently explaining concepts to each other, you inadvertently produce precious explanations that benefit other people.

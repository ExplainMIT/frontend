We want to bring a visual revolution to education

* **[Problem:](https://medium.com/@eltonlin1998/look-and-youll-see-71cb92125baa)** 
Visual explanations are scarce because people don't have time to make them
* **[Insight:](https://medium.com/@eltonlin1998/how-explainmit-optimizes-efficiency-for-content-creation-b0162895ff81)** 
People explain things to each other all the time
* **[Solution:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POis_ihKexo)**
Get them to use online blackboards so their explanations are automatically converted to visual explanations

## TEAM
ExplainMIT is a school project with the goal to make every class at MIT more fun and efficient. The day that becomes reality, we will consider transitioning into a startup.

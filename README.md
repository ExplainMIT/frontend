# Explain
Our mission is to make MIT a vibrant place where everyone helps each other, so nobody has to stay up late studying alone. In doing so, we will accelerate the world's transition into open education.

## Inspirations
The project was inspired by many things. [The Number Devil](https://booksjar.com/pdf-epub-the-number-devil-a-mathematical-adventure-download/), [Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman](https://b-ok.global/book/1673299/ae9bd9?regionChanged=&redirect=20279758), Dr Hiluluk from One Piece, Discord, ExplainEverything, Piazza and Maplestory. 

Everything starts with a question. "What is the intuition behind P = NP?". The Number Devil responds, and invites you to a classroom. The devil draws on the whiteboard, and soon the doodles come to life.

The devil focuses on the thought process: "Notice that the complexity class of the oracle machine is ... that's exactly the same as ..." "Why do the sets intersect there?" "Ah, I'm glad that you asked that, it's because..." ... ... ... "There's a very interesting quote about the concept if you want to hear:

"If P = NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place...There would be no special value in "creative leaps,"...Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss..."

 "Ah, everything makes sense now!"

That magical Eureka moment, the inexplicable journey from chaos to clarity that you just undertook - how wonderful.

"Thank you for that - my friends and I really struggled with the last few lectures..." "Happy to help. If your friends still have problems with this, just try explaining to them the same thing. Remember what Richard Feynman said - if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it." "Yes." "And, one more thing, in case you forget what I said..."

The devil presses a button, and right before their eyes, the messy scribbles on the whiteboard clear up. Then strokes start reappearing and rearranging themselves. Venn diagrams, Directed Acylic Graphs and equations, everything that the devil talked about and scribbled came back to life - like a vivid dance of words and numbers, moving in harmony to convey meaning in the most elegant of ways. It was as if they relived the journey towards clarity once more.

"Good luck for your midterm. Remember, always spread the joy of learning to the people around you!"

And just like that, the devil disappears. 

## Technology
Our frontend is Vue.js, Firebase for almost everything else, and Twilio-Video for real-time communications. 

Technical milestones: 
  - Feynman videos are 10-120x lighter than normal videos.

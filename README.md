# Explain
>Our dream is to cure everyone who suffers from a disease of the heart, and our mission is to accelerate world education in order to help society's battle against poverty, corruption and climate change. 

## Plan
**Part I: Create a vibrant, electrifying community at MIT where everybody helps each other**
This will involve an open-source, experimental prototype that drastically increases learning efficiency. It will also involve creating a system where, no matter how behind anyone feels, they'd know that there is an army of classmates and TAs who would jump at the opportunity to help out. Everything happens recursively, students use Explain to pset better, developers use Explain to develop Explain, even professors can contribute and change the code with anything. It's the entire school coming together to help each other. 

**Part II: Create a startup that becomes the grand explanation platform for the world**
This will involve democratizing education so everyone regardless of their circumstances can access the best resources for free, therefore increasing their potential to change the world. 

**Part III: End poverty and pollution by 2035**
Education is ultimately a "sword" that needs to be directed at our most urgent problems.
